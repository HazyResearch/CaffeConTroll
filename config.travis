# This is the configuration file that the Makefile
# will use to compile CcT. We have the following dependencies:
#   * lmdb
#   * OpenBLAS or Atlas
#   * GoogleTest
#   * google-glog
#   * Boost
#
# If any of these libraries are not currently part of your
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH, please use the Makefile variables below
# to configure the compilation. Remember: use absolute paths!
