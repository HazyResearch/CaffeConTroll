Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the dependencies listed in .travis.yml, which are also the same
   dependencies as caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).
   Because our installation procedure is almost the same as caffe it makes 
   sense to start with these instructions.
2. Copy config.sample to .config and fill it out with your correct paths

Note: if you are using OpenBLAS, then you can install OpenBLAS 
from http://www.openblas.net/
  - Download and unpack the source
  - `make`
  - Add the OpenBLAS library to your path, e.g. using the command
  
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/OpenBLAS/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. To generate the caffe-ct executable, from the root CaffeConTroll directory,
   compile with:

> make clean && make -j all

5. You can also compile tests

> make clean && make -j test
