Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install the dependencies listed in .travis.yml, which are also the same
   dependencies as caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html).
   Because our installation procedure is almost the same as caffe it makes 
   sense to start with these instructions.
2. Copy config.sample to .config and fill it out with your correct paths.

   Note on BLAS:

    The BLAS type that you use can be the same as for Caffe.
    However, you currently need to modify .config to point to the paths you want to use.

    On OS X we recommend using the default BLAS libraries. For example, this
    configuration may work inside .config:

    BLAS_INCLUDE=/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/Headers
    BLAS_LIB_DIR=/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A
    BLAS_LIBS=BLAS LAPACK       # Mac libararies
    BLAS_DEFS=-D_USE_ATLAS

    On Linux, we currently recommend using OpenBLAS. First, install OpenBLAS from http://www.openblas.net/
      - Download and unpack the source
      - `make`
      - Add the OpenBLAS library to your path, e.g. using the command

    > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/OpenBLAS/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    Then, fill out the paths inside .config:

    BLAS_INCLUDE=/path/to/OpenBLAS
    BLAS_LIB_DIR=/path/to/OpenBLAS
    BLAS_LIBS=openblas          # OpenBLAS
    BLAS_DEFS=-D_USE_OPENBLAS


3. To generate the caffe-ct executable, from the root CaffeConTroll directory,
   compile with:

> make clean && make -j all

4. You can also compile tests

> make clean && make -j test
