To run on Azure Ubuntu on the D-Series VMs, run the script 

sudo ./azure_setup.bash

Once this is run, the VM will be set up and the following commands can be used:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/azureuser/CaffeConTroll/externals/OpenBLAS-0.2.14/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> cd CaffeConTroll/

Run CCT (already compiled)

> ./caffe-ct train tests/imagenet_train/solver/caffenet_solver_1000.prototxt -b tests/imgnet_toprocess.bin -o tests/model.bin

Argument description: 
- Run the net in "train" mode and specify the path to the solver
- Pass -b (optional) which tells CCT where to write the preprocessed data binary
- Pass -o (optional) which tells CCT where to write the output model binary


Other Instructions

Run tests by modifying the Makefile and recompiling
> make clean && make -j test && ./test

To run a network using ./caffe-ct (already compiled), compile with make all
> make clean && make -j all
> ./caffe-ct <arguments>
