To setup CcT on an Azure Ubuntu D-Series VM for the first time, run the script 

./azure_setup.bash

Only run this once. Once this is run, the VM will be set up and the following commands can be used:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/azureuser/CaffeConTroll/externals/OpenBLAS-0.2.14/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
> cd CaffeConTroll/

Run CCT (already compiled)

> ./caffe-ct train tests/imagenet_train/solver/caffenet_solver_1000_azure.prototxt -b tests/imgnet_toprocess.bin -o tests/model.bin

Argument description: 
- Run the net in "train" mode and specify the path to the solver
- Pass -b (optional) which tells CCT where to write the preprocessed data binary
- Pass -o (optional) which tells CCT where to write the output model binary
